Home Assistant is not available on the Play Store or App Store. Instead, Home Assistant leverages the new W3C [manifest.json](https://w3c.github.io/manifest/) support, allowing mobile devices to add the "web app" to your homescreen as if it was native.

On Android:

  1. Open Chrome
  2. Navigate to your Home Assistant instance
  3. Tap on the Menu icon (three vertical bars)
  4. Tap on Add to Homescreen
  5. A dialog will popup; tap on Add

  2. Navigate to your Home Assistant instance
  3. Tap on the Share icon in the middle of the bottom toolbar
  4. Tap on "Add to Home Screen"
  5. A dialog will popup; tap on Add
