Newer linux distributions are trending towards using `systemd` for managing daemons. Typically, systems based on Fedora, ArchLinux, or Debian (8 or later) use `systemd`. This includes Ubuntu releases including and after 15.04, CentOS, and Red Hat. If you are unsure if your system is using `systemd`, you may check with the following command:

```bash
$ ps -p 1 -o comm=
```

If the preceding command returns the string `systemd`, you are likely using `systemd`.

If you want Home Assistant to be launched automatically, an extra step is needed to setup `systemd`. You need a service file to control Home Assistant with `systemd`. If you are using a Raspberry Pi with Raspbian then replace the `[your user]` with `pi` otherwise use your user you want to run Home Assistant. `ExecStart` contains the path to `hass` and this may vary. Check with `whereis hass` for the location.

```bash
$ su -c 'cat <<EOF >> /etc/systemd/system/home-assistant@[your user].service
[Unit]
Description=Home Assistant
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=%i
ExecStart=/usr/bin/hass

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF'
```

If you've setup Home Assistant in virtualenv following the guide the following template should work for you.

```
[Unit]
Description=Home Assistant
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=hass
ExecStartPre=source /srv/hass/bin/activate
ExecStart=/srv/hass/bin/hass "/home/hass/.homeassistant"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

There is also another [sample service file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/master/script/home-assistant%40.service) available. To use this one, just download it.

```bash
$ sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/master/script/home-assistant%40.service -O /etc/systemd/system/home-assistant@[your user].service
```

You need to reload `systemd` to make the daemon aware of the new configuration. Enable and launch Home Assistant after that.

```bash
$ sudo systemctl --system daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl enable home-assistant@[your user]
$ sudo systemctl start home-assistant@[your user]
```

If everything went well, `sudo systemctl start home-assistant@[your user]` should give you a positive feedback.

```bash
$ sudo systemctl status home-assistant@[your user] -l

```

To get Home Assistant's logging output, simple use `journalctl`.

```bash
$ journalctl -f -u home-assistant@[your user]
```

Because the log can scroll quite quickly, you might want to open a second terminal to view only the errors:
```bash
$ journalctl -f -u home-assistant@[your user] | grep -i 'error'
```
